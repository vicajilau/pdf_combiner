/// such as Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. The `filePath` parameter
/// should be a valid local file path.
///
/// **Note:** This class is not used on web platforms, which have their own
/// file handling implementation through `DocumentUtilsWeb`.

  /// each file if it exists. For security reasons, it only deletes files that
  /// are located within the designated temporary folder returned by
  /// [getTemporalFolderPath].
  ///
  /// The method is automatically skipped when:
  /// - Running in mock mode ([PdfCombiner.isMock] is `true`)
  /// - Running on web platforms
